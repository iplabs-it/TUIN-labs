# HTTP Protocol Laboratory
## Student Exercise Guide

**Institute of Telecommunications**  
**Warsaw University of Technology**  
**2024/2025**

---

## Introduction

This laboratory introduces the HTTP protocol, caching mechanisms, and HTTPS/TLS security. You will use command-line tools (`curl`, `openssl`) to interact with web servers and analyze protocol behavior.

**Duration:** 2 hours. Lab 2 (HTTPS and Advanced Topics) is a separate session of about 2 hours and uses the same lab environment.

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic understanding of TCP/IP networking
- Familiarity with command line interface
- Knowledge of client-server architecture

---

## Lab Environment

The lab consists of four containers:

| Container | Role | Address |
|-----------|------|---------|
| client | Your workstation | - |
| cache-proxy | Caching reverse proxy | cache-proxy:80 |
| webserver | HTTP origin server | webserver:80 |
| https-server | HTTPS/TLS server | https-server:443 |

### Fetching the Lab Files

1. Start the lab VM and **make sure your host PC is online**. Open the terminal application.
2. Download the lab files. The commands depend on whether the `~/TUIN-labs`
   folder already exists on your VM. To check, run:

   ```bash
   ls -d ~/TUIN-labs/.git
   ```

   **Case A** – the command prints `/home/iplabs/TUIN-labs/.git` (a copy of the
   repository is already there). Fetch the latest version and merge the lab branch:

   ```bash
   cd ~/TUIN-labs
   git fetch
   git merge --no-edit origin/lab1-http
   ```

   **Case B** – the command reports *"No such file or directory"* (there is no
   repository yet). Clone the repository and merge the lab branch:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/iplabs-it/TUIN-labs.git
   cd TUIN-labs
   git merge --no-edit origin/lab1-http
   ```

3. Check the result. Both cases place the lab files in the `~/TUIN-labs/http` folder:

   ```bash
   ls ~/TUIN-labs/http
   ```

   The listing should include `bootstrap.sh` and `http-lab.clab.yml`. Running
   the Case A commands again later is safe – if nothing has changed, `git merge`
   just reports *"Already up to date"*.

> **⚠ Troubleshooting**
>
> - If `git fetch` reports *"not a git repository"*, `~/TUIN-labs` is not a
>   valid copy of the repository. Remove it with `rm -rf ~/TUIN-labs` and
>   follow Case B.
> - If `git merge` stops with *"Please tell me who you are"* or *"unable to
>   auto-detect email address"*, set a git identity once, then run the
>   `git merge` command again:
>
>   ```bash
>   git config --global user.name "TUIN Student"
>   git config --global user.email "student@tuin.lab"
>   ```

### Starting the Lab

Go to the lab folder, deploy the lab environment and connect to the client container:

```bash
cd ~/TUIN-labs/http

# Deploy the lab
./bootstrap.sh deploy

# Connect to the client container
./bootstrap.sh client
```

### Useful Commands

Once inside the client container, these helper commands are available:

- `webserver /path` - GET from origin server
- `proxy /path` - GET via caching proxy  
- `secure /path` - GET from HTTPS server
- `cache_test /path` - Test caching behavior
- `tls_info` - Show TLS certificate information

# LAB 1: HTTP Basics (Approx. 2 hours)

## Exercise A1: HTTP Request/Response Structure

### A1.1: Your First HTTP Request

Connect to the client and make a simple request:

```bash
curl -v http://webserver/
```

**Tasks:**
1. Identify the HTTP request line (method, path, version)
2. List all request headers sent by curl
3. Identify the HTTP response status line
4. What is the server software (check Server header)?
5. What Content-Type does the server return?

**Report:** Include the full request/response headers in your report.

### A1.2: Understanding Headers

Make a HEAD request to retrieve only headers:

```bash
curl -I http://webserver/
```

**Tasks:**
1. Compare the output with the previous GET request
2. What is the Content-Length?
3. Find the ETag value
4. Explain when HEAD method is useful

### A1.3: HTTP Methods

The server provides a simple REST API. Test different methods – the `-i`
option makes curl print the response status line and headers before the body:

```bash
# GET - retrieve items
curl -i http://webserver/api/items

# GET - single item
curl -i http://webserver/api/items/1

# POST - create item
curl -i -X POST http://webserver/api/items

# PUT - update item
curl -i -X PUT http://webserver/api/items/1

# DELETE - remove item
curl -i -X DELETE http://webserver/api/items/1
```

> **Note:** the API is simulated – it returns realistic responses, but changes
> are not stored (e.g. item 1 is still there after the DELETE).

**Tasks:**
1. What HTTP status code does POST return? Why?
2. What is the difference between PUT and POST semantically?
3. Try an unsupported method (e.g., PATCH) - what happens? Check the `Allow` header in the response.

---

## Exercise A2: Content Negotiation

### A2.1: Accept Headers

The server supports gzip compression. Compare:

```bash
# Without compression
curl -I http://webserver/

# Request compression
curl -I -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" http://webserver/

# Compare the number of body bytes actually transferred
curl -s http://webserver/ | wc -c
curl -s -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" http://webserver/ | wc -c
```

**Tasks:**
1. What header indicates the response is compressed?
2. Check the Vary header - what does it tell caches?
3. How many bytes does compression save for this page (absolute and in %)?
4. Compare the `ETag` and `Content-Length` headers of the two responses. Why
   does the ETag of the compressed response start with `W/`, and why is
   `Content-Length` missing?

### A2.2: User-Agent Behavior

Every request carries a `User-Agent` header identifying the client. The
`/api/echo` endpoint shows what the server received:

```bash
# Default curl User-Agent
curl http://webserver/api/echo

# Custom User-Agent
curl -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Educational Bot)" http://webserver/api/echo
```

Some servers behave differently based on User-Agent. The `/ua/` page
classifies the client and adapts its response:

```bash
curl -i http://webserver/ua/
curl -i -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Educational Bot)" http://webserver/ua/
curl -i -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) Firefox/128.0" http://webserver/ua/
```

**Tasks:**
1. Document the default User-Agent string curl sends
2. How does the server classify each client? Which response header reveals it?
3. The "Educational Bot" string starts with `Mozilla/5.0`, yet it is classified
   as a bot. Why do crawlers and other tools put `Mozilla/5.0` in their User-Agent?
4. The `/ua/` responses carry `Vary: User-Agent`. What does this tell a cache,
   and what would go wrong without it?
5. Why might servers care about User-Agent? Is it a reliable way to identify clients?

## Exercise A3: HTTP Caching Fundamentals

### A3.1: Understanding Cache-Control

The server has different caching strategies for different paths. Explore:

```bash
# Check headers for each path
curl -I http://webserver/static/styles.css
curl -I http://webserver/dynamic/
curl -I http://webserver/private/
curl -I http://webserver/validate/
curl -I http://webserver/news/
```

> **Note:** `X-Cache-Strategy` is an informal label added by the lab server
> to help you navigate. It is not a standard header – browsers and caches act
> only on `Cache-Control`.

**Tasks:**
1. Create a table showing the Cache-Control value for each path
2. Explain what each Cache-Control directive means:
   - `public` vs `private`
   - `max-age`
   - `no-cache` vs `no-store`
   - `must-revalidate`
   - `immutable`
   - `stale-while-revalidate`

### A3.2: ETag and Conditional Requests

ETags enable cache validation without downloading content again. In step 2,
the `-w` option makes curl print the status code and the number of body bytes
it received (`-o /dev/null` discards the body itself):

```bash
# Step 1: Get the ETag
curl -I http://webserver/validate/
# Note the ETag value, including its double quotes (e.g. "6ac6db0e-668")

# Step 2: Normal GET vs conditional GET
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{size_download} bytes\n" \
     http://webserver/validate/
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{size_download} bytes\n" \
     -H 'If-None-Match: "YOUR-ETAG-HERE"' http://webserver/validate/

# Step 3: Full headers of the conditional response
curl -i -H 'If-None-Match: "YOUR-ETAG-HERE"' http://webserver/validate/
```

Replace only `YOUR-ETAG-HERE`: the header value must contain the ETag inside
exactly one pair of double quotes, just as the server sent it. Without the
quotes (or with doubled quotes) the ETag does not match and you get `200`.

> **Tip:** instead of copying the value by hand, you can store it in a shell variable:
>
> ```bash
> ETAG=$(curl -sI http://webserver/validate/ | grep -i '^etag' | cut -d' ' -f2 | tr -d '\r')
> curl -i -H "If-None-Match: $ETAG" http://webserver/validate/
> ```

**Tasks:**
1. What status code do you receive for the conditional request?
2. Compare the number of body bytes of the normal and the conditional GET. Why
   does the conditional response carry no body?
3. Calculate the bandwidth saved if the resource was 1 MB.

### A3.3: Last-Modified and If-Modified-Since

Similar to ETag but time-based. First read the resource's `Last-Modified`,
then issue two conditional requests — one with a date *before* it (the
resource HAS changed since) and one with a date *at or after* it (the
resource has NOT changed since).

```bash
# Step 1: read Last-Modified
curl -I http://webserver/static/styles.css
# Note the Last-Modified value, e.g. "Sat, 16 May 2026 14:17:20 GMT"

# Step 2a: IMS in the past (resource has changed since) → expect 200 OK
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{size_download} bytes\n" \
     -H "If-Modified-Since: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT" \
     http://webserver/static/styles.css

# Step 2b: replay the actual Last-Modified value → expect 304 Not Modified
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{size_download} bytes\n" \
     -H "If-Modified-Since: <PASTE-LAST-MODIFIED-HERE>" \
     http://webserver/static/styles.css
```

**Tasks:**
1. What status code do you get for step 2a vs step 2b? Which response carries a body, and how large is it?
2. When would you use `If-Modified-Since` vs `If-None-Match`?
3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Consider clock skew,
   sub-second changes, and resources that change without their mtime changing.

## Exercise A4: Caching Proxy Behavior

### A4.1: Cache HIT vs MISS

Access content through the caching proxy and observe repeated requests:

```bash
# First request - should be MISS
curl -I http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css

# Second request - should be HIT
curl -I http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css

# Third request
curl -I http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css
```

> **Tip:** the proxy keeps cached content until the lab is redeployed, and
> `styles.css` may be cached for a whole year. If your *first* request already
> shows `HIT`, the file was cached by an earlier run. The query string is part
> of the cache key, so adding one gives you a fresh entry:
> `curl -I "http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css?run=2"`

**Tasks:**
1. Check the `X-Cache-Status` header for each request
2. Check the `Age` header - what does it represent? How does it relate to `max-age`?

### A4.2: Cache Bypass

Test paths that bypass the cache:

```bash
# Dynamic content - never cached
curl -I http://cache-proxy/dynamic/
curl -I http://cache-proxy/dynamic/

# API - never cached
curl -I http://cache-proxy/api/time
curl -I http://cache-proxy/api/time
```

**Tasks:**
1. Verify these always show MISS or BYPASS
2. `/dynamic/` shows `MISS`, but the API shows `BYPASS-API`. What is the
   difference? (Hint: compare the `Cache-Control` header of `/dynamic/` with
   the fact that the proxy is configured to skip its cache for `/api/`.)
3. Why should API responses typically not be cached?

### A4.3: Private Content

```bash
# Private content through proxy
curl -I http://cache-proxy/private/
curl -I http://cache-proxy/private/
```

A `MISS` on *every* request means the proxy never stores the response — unlike
a single `MISS` followed by `HIT`s.

**Tasks:**
1. Does the proxy cache private content?
2. Explain why this behavior is important for security

### A4.4: Expiry and Revalidation

Cached content does not stay fresh forever. `/news/` is fresh for 60 s
(`max-age=60`) and may then be served stale for 30 s more while the proxy
refreshes it (`stale-while-revalidate=30`). `/validate/` (`no-cache`) may be
stored, but must be revalidated with the origin before every reuse. The
`?run=1` query string gives you a fresh cache entry, so the timings below
work even if you requested `/news/` before; use another number if you repeat
the steps.

```bash
# /news/ - fresh for 60 s, then stale-while-revalidate for 30 s
curl -I "http://cache-proxy/news/?run=1"     # MISS
curl -I "http://cache-proxy/news/?run=1"     # HIT - note the Age
sleep 65
curl -I "http://cache-proxy/news/?run=1"     # STALE - refreshed in the background
curl -I "http://cache-proxy/news/?run=1"     # HIT - note the Age again

# /validate/ - no-cache: stored, but revalidated on every request
curl -I http://cache-proxy/validate/
curl -I http://cache-proxy/validate/
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{size_download} bytes\n" \
     -H 'If-None-Match: "YOUR-ETAG-HERE"' http://cache-proxy/validate/
```

Use the same ETag value as in A3.2. The values of `X-Cache-Status` used by
the proxy are:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `MISS` | Not in the cache (or not storable) – fetched from the origin |
| `HIT` | Served from the cache while still fresh |
| `EXPIRED` | Cached copy had expired – full response fetched from the origin |
| `STALE` | Expired copy served anyway (allowed by `stale-while-revalidate`, or because the origin is down) |
| `UPDATING` | Expired copy served while another request is refreshing it |
| `REVALIDATED` | Expired copy confirmed by the origin with `304 Not Modified` |
| `BYPASS` | Cache deliberately skipped (this lab labels it `BYPASS-API` for `/api/`) |

**Tasks:**
1. Record `X-Cache-Status` and `Age` for each `/news/` request. Why is the
   third response `STALE` rather than `MISS`, and what happens to `Age` afterwards?
2. What would happen if you waited longer than 90 s (max-age + stale-while-revalidate)
   before the third request? (Optional: try it with `?run=2` and `sleep 95`.)
3. Why does `/validate/` show `REVALIDATED` rather than `HIT`? What does the
   proxy send to the origin, and what does it get back?
4. Compare the conditional request through the proxy with the one you sent
   directly to the webserver in A3.2.
5. Which `X-Cache-Status` values did you observe across Exercise A4? Explain each.

## Deliverables

Submit a report containing:
1. Answers to all tasks
2. Screenshots/outputs demonstrating key concepts
3. A summary table of the caching strategies observed (consolidating Exercises A3 and A4): for each
   path, its `Cache-Control` value and the `X-Cache-Status` values seen through the proxy

---

## Final Checklist

Before submitting your report, ensure you have:

- [ ] Documented all HTTP methods tested
- [ ] Created a caching strategy comparison table
- [ ] Captured and analysed ETag / conditional requests

---

## Stopping the Lab

When you have finished, stop the lab so that it does not keep running
(and restart with every VM boot) until Lab 2:

```bash
# Exit client container
exit

# Stop the lab
./bootstrap.sh destroy
```

Lab 2 starts with *Preparing the Lab*, which updates the files and deploys
the lab again.

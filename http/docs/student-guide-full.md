# HTTP Protocol Laboratory
## Student Exercise Guide

**Institute of Telecommunications**  
**Warsaw University of Technology**  
**2024/2025**

---

## Introduction

This laboratory introduces the HTTP protocol, caching mechanisms, and HTTPS/TLS security. You will use command-line tools (`curl`, `openssl`) to interact with web servers and analyze protocol behavior.

**Duration:** 4 hours total (Lab 1: 2 hours, Lab 2: 2 hours)

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic understanding of TCP/IP networking
- Familiarity with command line interface
- Knowledge of client-server architecture

---

## Lab Environment

The lab consists of four containers:

| Container | Role | Address |
|-----------|------|---------|
| client | Your workstation | - |
| cache-proxy | Caching reverse proxy | cache-proxy:80 |
| webserver | HTTP origin server | webserver:80 |
| https-server | HTTPS/TLS server | https-server:443 |

### Fetching the Lab Files

1. Start the lab VM and **make sure your host PC is online**. Open the terminal application.
2. Download the lab files. The commands depend on whether the `~/TUIN-labs`
   folder already exists on your VM. To check, run:

   ```bash
   ls -d ~/TUIN-labs/.git
   ```

   **Case A** – the command prints `/home/iplabs/TUIN-labs/.git` (a copy of the
   repository is already there). Fetch the latest version and merge the lab branch:

   ```bash
   cd ~/TUIN-labs
   git fetch
   git merge --no-edit origin/lab1-http
   ```

   **Case B** – the command reports *"No such file or directory"* (there is no
   repository yet). Clone the repository and merge the lab branch:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/iplabs-it/TUIN-labs.git
   cd TUIN-labs
   git merge --no-edit origin/lab1-http
   ```

3. Check the result. Both cases place the lab files in the `~/TUIN-labs/http` folder:

   ```bash
   ls ~/TUIN-labs/http
   ```

   The listing should include `bootstrap.sh` and `http-lab.clab.yml`. Running
   the Case A commands again later is safe – if nothing has changed, `git merge`
   just reports *"Already up to date"*.

> **⚠ Troubleshooting**
>
> - If `git fetch` reports *"not a git repository"*, `~/TUIN-labs` is not a
>   valid copy of the repository. Remove it with `rm -rf ~/TUIN-labs` and
>   follow Case B.
> - If `git merge` stops with *"Please tell me who you are"* or *"unable to
>   auto-detect email address"*, set a git identity once, then run the
>   `git merge` command again:
>
>   ```bash
>   git config --global user.name "TUIN Student"
>   git config --global user.email "student@tuin.lab"
>   ```

### Starting the Lab

Go to the lab folder, deploy the lab environment and connect to the client container:

```bash
cd ~/TUIN-labs/http

# Deploy the lab
./bootstrap.sh deploy

# Connect to the client container
./bootstrap.sh client
```

### Useful Commands

Once inside the client container, these helper commands are available:

- `webserver /path` - GET from origin server
- `proxy /path` - GET via caching proxy  
- `secure /path` - GET from HTTPS server
- `cache_test /path` - Test caching behavior
- `tls_info` - Show TLS certificate information

---

# LAB 1: HTTP Basics (Approx. 2 hours)

## Exercise A1: HTTP Request/Response Structure

### A1.1: Your First HTTP Request

Connect to the client and make a simple request:

```bash
curl -v http://webserver/
```

**Tasks:**
1. Identify the HTTP request line (method, path, version)
2. List all request headers sent by curl
3. Identify the HTTP response status line
4. What is the server software (check Server header)?
5. What Content-Type does the server return?

**Report:** Include the full request/response headers in your report.

### A1.2: Understanding Headers

Make a HEAD request to retrieve only headers:

```bash
curl -I http://webserver/
```

**Tasks:**
1. Compare the output with the previous GET request
2. What is the Content-Length?
3. Find the ETag value
4. Explain when HEAD method is useful

### A1.3: HTTP Methods

The server provides a simple REST API. Test different methods – the `-i`
option makes curl print the response status line and headers before the body:

```bash
# GET - retrieve items
curl -i http://webserver/api/items

# GET - single item
curl -i http://webserver/api/items/1

# POST - create item
curl -i -X POST http://webserver/api/items

# PUT - update item
curl -i -X PUT http://webserver/api/items/1

# DELETE - remove item
curl -i -X DELETE http://webserver/api/items/1
```

> **Note:** the API is simulated – it returns realistic responses, but changes
> are not stored (e.g. item 1 is still there after the DELETE).

**Tasks:**
1. What HTTP status code does POST return? Why?
2. What is the difference between PUT and POST semantically?
3. Try an unsupported method (e.g., PATCH) - what happens? Check the `Allow` header in the response.

---

## Exercise A2: Content Negotiation

### A2.1: Accept Headers

The server supports gzip compression. Compare:

```bash
# Without compression
curl -I http://webserver/

# Request compression
curl -I -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" http://webserver/

# Compare the number of body bytes actually transferred
curl -s http://webserver/ | wc -c
curl -s -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" http://webserver/ | wc -c
```

**Tasks:**
1. What header indicates the response is compressed?
2. Check the Vary header - what does it tell caches?
3. How many bytes does compression save for this page (absolute and in %)?
4. Compare the `ETag` and `Content-Length` headers of the two responses. Why
   does the ETag of the compressed response start with `W/`, and why is
   `Content-Length` missing?

### A2.2: User-Agent Behavior

Every request carries a `User-Agent` header identifying the client. The
`/api/echo` endpoint shows what the server received:

```bash
# Default curl User-Agent
curl http://webserver/api/echo

# Custom User-Agent
curl -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Educational Bot)" http://webserver/api/echo
```

Some servers behave differently based on User-Agent. The `/ua/` page
classifies the client and adapts its response:

```bash
curl -i http://webserver/ua/
curl -i -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Educational Bot)" http://webserver/ua/
curl -i -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) Firefox/128.0" http://webserver/ua/
```

**Tasks:**
1. Document the default User-Agent string curl sends
2. How does the server classify each client? Which response header reveals it?
3. The "Educational Bot" string starts with `Mozilla/5.0`, yet it is classified
   as a bot. Why do crawlers and other tools put `Mozilla/5.0` in their User-Agent?
4. The `/ua/` responses carry `Vary: User-Agent`. What does this tell a cache,
   and what would go wrong without it?
5. Why might servers care about User-Agent? Is it a reliable way to identify clients?

---

## Exercise A3: HTTP Caching Fundamentals

### A3.1: Understanding Cache-Control

The server has different caching strategies for different paths. Explore:

```bash
# Check headers for each path
curl -I http://webserver/static/styles.css
curl -I http://webserver/dynamic/
curl -I http://webserver/private/
curl -I http://webserver/validate/
curl -I http://webserver/news/
```

> **Note:** `X-Cache-Strategy` is an informal label added by the lab server
> to help you navigate. It is not a standard header – browsers and caches act
> only on `Cache-Control`.

**Tasks:**
1. Create a table showing the Cache-Control value for each path
2. Explain what each Cache-Control directive means:
   - `public` vs `private`
   - `max-age`
   - `no-cache` vs `no-store`
   - `must-revalidate`
   - `immutable`
   - `stale-while-revalidate`

### A3.2: ETag and Conditional Requests

ETags enable cache validation without downloading content again. In step 2,
the `-w` option makes curl print the status code and the number of body bytes
it received (`-o /dev/null` discards the body itself):

```bash
# Step 1: Get the ETag
curl -I http://webserver/validate/
# Note the ETag value, including its double quotes (e.g. "6ac6db0e-668")

# Step 2: Normal GET vs conditional GET
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{size_download} bytes\n" \
     http://webserver/validate/
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{size_download} bytes\n" \
     -H 'If-None-Match: "YOUR-ETAG-HERE"' http://webserver/validate/

# Step 3: Full headers of the conditional response
curl -i -H 'If-None-Match: "YOUR-ETAG-HERE"' http://webserver/validate/
```

Replace only `YOUR-ETAG-HERE`: the header value must contain the ETag inside
exactly one pair of double quotes, just as the server sent it. Without the
quotes (or with doubled quotes) the ETag does not match and you get `200`.

> **Tip:** instead of copying the value by hand, you can store it in a shell variable:
>
> ```bash
> ETAG=$(curl -sI http://webserver/validate/ | grep -i '^etag' | cut -d' ' -f2 | tr -d '\r')
> curl -i -H "If-None-Match: $ETAG" http://webserver/validate/
> ```

**Tasks:**
1. What status code do you receive for the conditional request?
2. Compare the number of body bytes of the normal and the conditional GET. Why
   does the conditional response carry no body?
3. Calculate the bandwidth saved if the resource was 1 MB.

### A3.3: Last-Modified and If-Modified-Since

Similar to ETag but time-based. First read the resource's `Last-Modified`,
then issue two conditional requests — one with a date *before* it (the
resource HAS changed since) and one with a date *at or after* it (the
resource has NOT changed since).

```bash
# Step 1: read Last-Modified
curl -I http://webserver/static/styles.css
# Note the Last-Modified value, e.g. "Sat, 16 May 2026 14:17:20 GMT"

# Step 2a: IMS in the past (resource has changed since) → expect 200 OK
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{size_download} bytes\n" \
     -H "If-Modified-Since: Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT" \
     http://webserver/static/styles.css

# Step 2b: replay the actual Last-Modified value → expect 304 Not Modified
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{size_download} bytes\n" \
     -H "If-Modified-Since: <PASTE-LAST-MODIFIED-HERE>" \
     http://webserver/static/styles.css
```

**Tasks:**
1. What status code do you get for step 2a vs step 2b? Which response carries a body, and how large is it?
2. When would you use `If-Modified-Since` vs `If-None-Match`?
3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Consider clock skew,
   sub-second changes, and resources that change without their mtime changing.

## Exercise A4: Caching Proxy Behavior

### A4.1: Cache HIT vs MISS

Access content through the caching proxy and observe repeated requests:

```bash
# First request - should be MISS
curl -I http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css

# Second request - should be HIT
curl -I http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css

# Third request
curl -I http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css
```

> **Tip:** the proxy keeps cached content until the lab is redeployed, and
> `styles.css` may be cached for a whole year. If your *first* request already
> shows `HIT`, the file was cached by an earlier run. The query string is part
> of the cache key, so adding one gives you a fresh entry:
> `curl -I "http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css?run=2"`

**Tasks:**
1. Check the `X-Cache-Status` header for each request
2. Check the `Age` header - what does it represent? How does it relate to `max-age`?

### A4.2: Cache Bypass

Test paths that bypass the cache:

```bash
# Dynamic content - never cached
curl -I http://cache-proxy/dynamic/
curl -I http://cache-proxy/dynamic/

# API - never cached
curl -I http://cache-proxy/api/time
curl -I http://cache-proxy/api/time
```

**Tasks:**
1. Verify these always show MISS or BYPASS
2. `/dynamic/` shows `MISS`, but the API shows `BYPASS-API`. What is the
   difference? (Hint: compare the `Cache-Control` header of `/dynamic/` with
   the fact that the proxy is configured to skip its cache for `/api/`.)
3. Why should API responses typically not be cached?

### A4.3: Private Content

```bash
# Private content through proxy
curl -I http://cache-proxy/private/
curl -I http://cache-proxy/private/
```

A `MISS` on *every* request means the proxy never stores the response — unlike
a single `MISS` followed by `HIT`s.

**Tasks:**
1. Does the proxy cache private content?
2. Explain why this behavior is important for security

### A4.4: Expiry and Revalidation

Cached content does not stay fresh forever. `/news/` is fresh for 60 s
(`max-age=60`) and may then be served stale for 30 s more while the proxy
refreshes it (`stale-while-revalidate=30`). `/validate/` (`no-cache`) may be
stored, but must be revalidated with the origin before every reuse. The
`?run=1` query string gives you a fresh cache entry, so the timings below
work even if you requested `/news/` before; use another number if you repeat
the steps.

```bash
# /news/ - fresh for 60 s, then stale-while-revalidate for 30 s
curl -I "http://cache-proxy/news/?run=1"     # MISS
curl -I "http://cache-proxy/news/?run=1"     # HIT - note the Age
sleep 65
curl -I "http://cache-proxy/news/?run=1"     # STALE - refreshed in the background
curl -I "http://cache-proxy/news/?run=1"     # HIT - note the Age again

# /validate/ - no-cache: stored, but revalidated on every request
curl -I http://cache-proxy/validate/
curl -I http://cache-proxy/validate/
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{size_download} bytes\n" \
     -H 'If-None-Match: "YOUR-ETAG-HERE"' http://cache-proxy/validate/
```

Use the same ETag value as in A3.2. The values of `X-Cache-Status` used by
the proxy are:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `MISS` | Not in the cache (or not storable) – fetched from the origin |
| `HIT` | Served from the cache while still fresh |
| `EXPIRED` | Cached copy had expired – full response fetched from the origin |
| `STALE` | Expired copy served anyway (allowed by `stale-while-revalidate`, or because the origin is down) |
| `UPDATING` | Expired copy served while another request is refreshing it |
| `REVALIDATED` | Expired copy confirmed by the origin with `304 Not Modified` |
| `BYPASS` | Cache deliberately skipped (this lab labels it `BYPASS-API` for `/api/`) |

**Tasks:**
1. Record `X-Cache-Status` and `Age` for each `/news/` request. Why is the
   third response `STALE` rather than `MISS`, and what happens to `Age` afterwards?
2. What would happen if you waited longer than 90 s (max-age + stale-while-revalidate)
   before the third request? (Optional: try it with `?run=2` and `sleep 95`.)
3. Why does `/validate/` show `REVALIDATED` rather than `HIT`? What does the
   proxy send to the origin, and what does it get back?
4. Compare the conditional request through the proxy with the one you sent
   directly to the webserver in A3.2.
5. Which `X-Cache-Status` values did you observe across Exercise A4? Explain each.

## Deliverables

Submit a report containing:
1. Answers to all tasks
2. Screenshots/outputs demonstrating key concepts
3. A summary table of the caching strategies observed (consolidating Exercises A3 and A4): for each
   path, its `Cache-Control` value and the `X-Cache-Status` values seen through the proxy

---

## Final Checklist (Lab 1)

Before submitting your Lab 1 report, ensure you have:

- [ ] Documented all HTTP methods tested
- [ ] Created a caching strategy comparison table
- [ ] Captured and analysed ETag / conditional requests

---

## Stopping the Lab

When you have finished, stop the lab so that it does not keep running
(and restart with every VM boot) until Lab 2:

```bash
# Exit client container
exit

# Stop the lab
./bootstrap.sh destroy
```

Lab 2 starts with *Preparing the Lab*, which updates the files and deploys
the lab again.

---
# LAB 2: HTTPS and Advanced Topics (Approx. 2 hours)

---

## Preparing the Lab

Lab 2 is a separate lab session, usually some weeks after Lab 1, on the
same VM. In the meantime the lab files may have been updated, and the Lab 1
environment may still be running: after a VM reboot its containers restart
automatically, but with the **old** configuration. Prepare the lab as follows:

1. Start the lab VM and **make sure your host PC is online**. Open the terminal application.
2. Fetch the latest lab files and merge the latest version of the HTTP-lab branch:

   ```bash
   cd ~/TUIN-labs
   git fetch
   git merge --no-edit origin/lab2-https
   ```

   - If git reports *"Your local changes to the following files would be
     overwritten by merge"*, you edited lab files during Lab 1. Discard those
     edits with `git restore .` and run the `git merge` command again. (Your
     files in `content/saved/` are not affected.)
   - If `~/TUIN-labs` does not exist, follow *Fetching the Lab Files* in the
     Lab 1 manual (Case B).

3. **Always redeploy the lab**, even if it seems to be running – this replaces
   any old containers with fresh ones that use the updated files:

   ```bash
   cd ~/TUIN-labs/http
   ./bootstrap.sh deploy
   ./bootstrap.sh client
   ```

   The cache of the proxy starts empty after a redeploy; this is expected.
   Files you saved in `/home/student/saved` during Lab 1 are kept.

The helper commands from Lab 1 (`webserver`, `proxy`, `secure`, `cache_test`,
`tls_info`, `tls_handshake`) are available in the client again.

## Exercise B1: HTTPS and TLS

### B1.1: TLS Handshake Observation

Connect to the HTTPS server and observe the TLS handshake:

```bash
# Verbose TLS connection
openssl s_client -connect https-server:443 -state </dev/null
```

`</dev/null` closes the connection right after the handshake. Without it,
`s_client` stays connected and waits for you to type an HTTP request – press
`Ctrl+C` to leave.

**Tasks:**
1. Identify the TLS version negotiated
2. List the handshake states observed
3. What cipher suite was selected?
4. How many certificates are in the chain?

### B1.2: Certificate Inspection

Examine the server certificate in detail:

```bash
# View certificate details
openssl s_client -connect https-server:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null | \
  openssl x509 -noout -text
```

**Tasks:**
1. Who is the certificate issuer (CA)?
2. Who is the subject?
3. What are the Subject Alternative Names (SANs)?
4. When does the certificate expire?
5. What signature algorithm and public key type are used?

### B1.3: Certificate Chain

```bash
# Show full certificate chain
openssl s_client -connect https-server:443 -showcerts </dev/null
```

**Tasks:**
1. How many certificates are shown?
2. Draw the trust chain (CA → Server)
3. Why is a certificate chain necessary?
4. This lab server also sends the root CA certificate. Real servers usually
   send only their own certificate and the intermediate CA(s). Why is sending
   the root unnecessary?

### B1.4: Cipher Suite Analysis

```bash
# Which TLS 1.2 ciphers does the server accept? (tests each cipher in turn)
for c in $(openssl ciphers 'ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL' | tr ':' ' '); do
  openssl s_client -connect https-server:443 -tls1_2 -cipher "$c" \
    </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "accepted: $c"
done

# Which TLS 1.3 cipher suites does the server accept?
for c in TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256; do
  openssl s_client -connect https-server:443 -tls1_3 -ciphersuites "$c" \
    </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "accepted: $c"
done

# Which cipher is negotiated for each TLS version?
openssl s_client -connect https-server:443 -tls1_2 </dev/null 2>&1 | \
  grep -E "(Protocol|Cipher)"
openssl s_client -connect https-server:443 -tls1_3 </dev/null 2>&1 | \
  grep -E "(Protocol|Cipher)"
```

**Tasks:**
1. What cipher is used with TLS 1.2? What cipher is used with TLS 1.3?
2. The server is configured with four TLS 1.2 ciphers – two `ECDHE-ECDSA-…`
   and two `ECDHE-RSA-…`. Which ones are accepted, and why? (Hint: the public
   key type you found in B1.2.)
3. Why are different ciphers used for different TLS versions?

---

## Exercise B2: HTTPS vs HTTP in Practice

### B2.1: Traffic Comparison

Capture the traffic of one HTTP request. `timeout 5` stops the capture after
5 seconds, and `wait` waits until it has finished. `-n` keeps tcpdump from
replacing addresses with host names, so a server name can only appear inside
the packets themselves:

```bash
# Capture HTTP traffic in the background
timeout 5 tcpdump -n -i any -A -s 0 'port 80' > /tmp/http-capture.txt &
sleep 1

# Make an HTTP request
curl -s http://webserver/ > /dev/null

# Wait for the capture to finish, then view it
wait
cat /tmp/http-capture.txt
```

Now capture HTTPS traffic the same way:

```bash
timeout 5 tcpdump -n -i any -A -s 0 'port 443' > /tmp/https-capture.txt &
sleep 1
curl -s https://https-server/ > /dev/null
wait
cat /tmp/https-capture.txt
```

**Tasks:**
1. Can you read the HTTP request/response in the first capture?
2. Can you read anything meaningful in the HTTPS capture?
3. What specific information is visible even in encrypted traffic? (Hint:
   search the HTTPS capture for the server's name – where in the TLS
   handshake does it come from?)

### B2.2: Security Headers

```bash
curl -I https://https-server/
```

The lab's CA certificate is installed in the client's trust store, so curl can
verify the server certificate. On servers with self-signed certificates you
will often see `curl -k` instead.

**Tasks:**
1. Find and explain each security header:
   - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-XSS-Protection
   - Content-Security-Policy
   - Referrer-Policy
2. What attack does each header help prevent?
3. `X-XSS-Protection` is deprecated and ignored by modern browsers. What
   replaces it?
4. What does curl's `-k` option do, and why is it not needed here?

### B2.3: HTTP to HTTPS Redirect

```bash
# Try HTTP on HTTPS server (port 80)
curl -I http://https-server/

# Follow redirect
curl -I -L http://https-server/
```

**Tasks:**
1. What status code triggers the redirect?
2. What is the Location header value?
3. Why is automatic HTTP→HTTPS redirect important?

---

## Exercise B3: Advanced Caching Scenarios

### B3.1: Stale-While-Revalidate – Inside and Outside the Window

In A4.4 you saw a stale copy being served shortly after `max-age` expired.
Here you compare two cached copies of `/news/` (`max-age=60`,
`stale-while-revalidate=30`): copy **a** is requested again *inside* the
stale window, copy **b** only *after* it. The query string makes them two
separate cache entries. The whole sequence takes about 95 s:

```bash
curl -sI "http://cache-proxy/news/?copy=a" | grep -iE '^age|x-cache-status'
curl -sI "http://cache-proxy/news/?copy=b" | grep -iE '^age|x-cache-status'
sleep 65
echo "--- copy a after 65 s:"
curl -sI "http://cache-proxy/news/?copy=a" | grep -iE '^age|x-cache-status'
sleep 30
echo "--- copy b after 95 s:"
curl -sI "http://cache-proxy/news/?copy=b" | grep -iE '^age|x-cache-status'
echo "--- copy a again:"
curl -sI "http://cache-proxy/news/?copy=a" | grep -iE '^age|x-cache-status'
```

If you repeat the steps, use new names (e.g. `?copy=c`, `?copy=d`).

**Tasks:**
1. Record `X-Cache-Status` and `Age` for each request.
2. Why is copy **a** served `STALE` after 65 s, but copy **b** `REVALIDATED` after 95 s?
3. For which of the two requests did the client have to wait for the origin
   server? Explain the benefit of stale-while-revalidate for user experience.
4. At the end, copy **a** is a `HIT` with `Age` ≈ 30, although it was first
   fetched 95 s earlier. Why?

### B3.2: Vary Header Impact

Request the same resource through the proxy with and without compression:

```bash
curl -sI http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css | grep -iE '^vary|content-encoding|x-cache-status'
curl -sI -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css | grep -iE '^vary|content-encoding|x-cache-status'
curl -sI http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css | grep -iE 'x-cache-status'
curl -sI -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css | grep -iE 'x-cache-status'
```

**Tasks:**
1. What is the Vary header set to?
2. Why is the first gzip request a `MISS`, even though the plain copy is
   already cached? How many copies of `styles.css` does the proxy now hold?
3. How does Vary affect caching behavior?
4. Why might too many Vary values hurt cache efficiency? (Think of
   `Vary: User-Agent` on the `/ua/` page from A2.2.)

### B3.3: Cache Invalidation Strategies

In a production environment, you often need to invalidate cached content
before it expires. The lab proxy supports **purging**: a `PURGE` request
removes a URL from the cache.

```bash
# Check current cache state (should be HIT after B3.2)
curl -sI http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css | grep -iE 'x-cache-status|^age'

# Purge the cached copies of styles.css
curl -X PURGE http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css

# The next request has to go to the origin again
curl -sI http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css | grep -iE 'x-cache-status|^age'

# Alternative strategy: a versioned URL is a new cache key
curl -sI "http://cache-proxy/static/styles.css?v=2" | grep -iE 'x-cache-status'
```

**Tasks:**
1. What does the proxy report after the purge, and how many files were
   removed? Relate the number to B3.2.
2. Compare three invalidation strategies you have now seen in the lab:
   expiry (`max-age`, A4.4), purging, and versioned URLs (`?v=2`). What are
   the advantages and disadvantages of each? Why are versioned URLs a natural
   fit for resources sent with `immutable`?
3. What is the "cache invalidation" problem in computer science?
4. How do CDNs handle cache invalidation?

## Exercise B4: HTTP Performance Analysis

### B4.1: Connection Timing

```bash
# Detailed timing information
curl -w "\nTime breakdown:\n\
  DNS lookup: %{time_namelookup}s\n\
  TCP connect: %{time_connect}s\n\
  TLS handshake: %{time_appconnect}s\n\
  Time to first byte: %{time_starttransfer}s\n\
  Total time: %{time_total}s\n" \
  -o /dev/null -s http://webserver/

curl -w "\nTime breakdown:\n\
  DNS lookup: %{time_namelookup}s\n\
  TCP connect: %{time_connect}s\n\
  TLS handshake: %{time_appconnect}s\n\
  Time to first byte: %{time_starttransfer}s\n\
  Total time: %{time_total}s\n" \
  -o /dev/null -s https://https-server/
```

The values are cumulative: each one is measured from the start of the request.
Run each command a few times – single measurements vary.

> **Note:** if all phases show exactly the same value (e.g. `0.024000s`
> everywhere), the VM's clock is too coarse for this measurement – ask your
> instructor.

**Tasks:**
1. Compare HTTP vs HTTPS timing
2. What additional overhead does TLS add?
3. Which phase takes the longest?

### B4.2: Keep-Alive Connections

```bash
# Multiple requests, new connection each time
time (for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do curl -s http://webserver/ > /dev/null; done)

# Multiple requests, reusing connection
time curl -s http://webserver/ http://webserver/ http://webserver/ \
          http://webserver/ http://webserver/ > /dev/null

# Show that curl reuses the connection
curl -sv http://webserver/ http://webserver/ -o /dev/null -o /dev/null 2>&1 | \
  grep -iE "connected to|re-using"
```

**Tasks:**
1. Compare the total time for both approaches
2. Why is connection reuse important?
3. What HTTP header controls keep-alive behavior?

## Exercise B5: Practical Scenarios

### B5.1: Building a Simple Website Download

Download all resources for offline viewing. The client's `/home/student/saved`
folder is shared with the VM: on the VM it is
`~/TUIN-labs/http/content/saved`.

```bash
cd /home/student/saved

# Download main page
curl http://webserver/ -o index.html

# Download CSS
curl http://webserver/static/styles.css -o styles.css

# Download JavaScript
curl http://webserver/static/tracker.js -o tracker.js

# Download image
curl http://webserver/static/images/network-diagram.svg \
  -o network-diagram.svg
```

To view the page, open
`file:///home/iplabs/TUIN-labs/http/content/saved/index.html` in the VM's web
browser. You can edit `index.html` inside the client with `vi`, or on the VM
after you leave the client shell with `exit` – `./bootstrap.sh client` then
hands the saved files over to your VM user.

**Tasks:**
1. Edit index.html to fix the resource paths for local viewing
2. Verify the page renders correctly
3. What tool automates this process? (hint: wget with options)

### B5.2: API Interaction Script

Create a script that interacts with the REST API. Save it as
`/home/student/saved/api-test.sh`, so that it is kept on the VM
(`~/TUIN-labs/http/content/saved/api-test.sh`) after the lab is stopped:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

printf '=== Getting all items ===\n'
curl -s http://webserver/api/items | jq .

printf '\n=== Getting item 1 ===\n'
curl -s http://webserver/api/items/1 | jq .

printf '\n=== Creating new item ===\n'
curl -s -X POST http://webserver/api/items | jq .

printf '\n=== Updating item 2 ===\n'
curl -s -X PUT http://webserver/api/items/2 | jq .

printf '\n=== Deleting item 3 ===\n'
curl -s -X DELETE http://webserver/api/items/3 | jq .
```

Run it with `sh /home/student/saved/api-test.sh`.

**Tasks:**
1. Run the script and document the output
2. What would you add for error handling?
3. How would you add authentication to API requests?

## Deliverables

Submit a report containing:
1. Answers to all tasks with supporting evidence
2. TLS certificate analysis with chain diagram
3. Performance comparison between HTTP and HTTPS
4. Analysis of at least 3 caching scenarios
5. Working API interaction script

---

## Final Checklist (Lab 2)

Before submitting your Lab 2 report, ensure you have:

- [ ] Examined TLS handshake and certificates
- [ ] Compared HTTP vs HTTPS traffic visibility
- [ ] Tested stale-while-revalidate behavior
- [ ] Purged a cached resource and compared invalidation strategies
- [ ] Measured HTTP vs HTTPS performance
- [ ] Downloaded and fixed website for offline viewing

---

## Stopping the Lab

When finished:

```bash
# Exit client container
exit

# Stop the lab
./bootstrap.sh destroy
```

Files in `~/TUIN-labs/http/content/saved` (your downloaded website and
`api-test.sh`) stay on the VM after the lab is stopped.
